This directory has a rich Pokemon Sqlite database (generated by software found here: https://github.com/veekun/pokedex thanks to Veekun for creating this). It also has a bunch of sql statements that provide example queries into the database, e.g. the file gen1Moves.sql lists all the moves found in generation 1, along with the move type.

Usage:
------------
1. Make sure you have a sqlite engine (I used sqlite3)
2. Pipe the .sql statements into the sqlite engine, like so: 
	$ sqlite3 pokedex.sqlite < gen1Moves.sql
	name        name
	----------  ----------
	Pound       Normal
	DoubleSlap  Normal
	Comet Punc  Normal
	Mega Punch  Normal
	...         ...
